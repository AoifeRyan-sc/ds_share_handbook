To help streamline this, I suggest we follow the following guidelines to help ensure we are consistent with our writing style. Some of these points will not be relevant for all section, but I think we would be wise to always keep them in the back of our mind throughout:\n\nTone, we should be friendly but professional. We can definitely joke, but always try and make sure the point we are getting across is clear.\nLet’s make sure we use the active voice rather than passive voice and talk in the first person plural (i.e. we, us rather than I, me etc).\nIf we are referring to a general data scientist or person, let’s be inclusive and refer to them as “they/them”. For example if we had the sentence “Imagine a data scientist needs to embed a sentence, there are many models available on HuggingFace for them to choose from”.\nWe need to take responsibility for what we write (this will be more relevant in the later sections of the handbook). We need to be make sure we understand concepts before committing them to the handbook- the creation of this handbook will not only help any newcomer get on board quicker, but also help cement DS concepts ourselves.\n\n\n“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough” - Albert Einstein",

    "section": "Overview of approach",
    "text": "Overview of approach\nPeaks and pits have gone through many iterations throughout the past year and a half. Currently, the general workflow is to use utilise a model framework known as SetFit to efficiently train a text classification model with limited training data. This fine-tuned model is then able to run inference over large datasets to label posts as either peaks, pits, or neither. We then utilise the LLM capabilities to refine these peak and pit moments into a collection of posts we are extremely confident are peaks and/or pits. We then employ topic modelling to identify groups of similar peaks and pits, to help us organise and discover hidden topics or themes within this collection of core moments.\nThis whole process can be split into seven distinct steps:\n\nExtract brand/product mentions from Sprinklr (the start of any project)\nObtain project-specific exemplar posts to help fine-tune a text classification model\nPerform model fine-tuning through contrastive learning\nRun inference over all of the project specific data\nUse GPT-3.5 for an extra layer of classification on identified peaks and pits\nTurn moments into something interpretable using topic modelling\n\n\n\n\nSchematic workflow from Project 706 - Peaks and Pits in M365 Apps\n\n\n\nObtain posts for the project (Step 1)\nThis step relies on the analysts to export relevant mentions from Sprinklr (one of the social listening tools that analysts utilise to obtain social data), and therefore is not detailed much here. What is required is one dataset for each of the brands/products, so they can be analysed separately.\n\n\nIdentify project-specific exemplar peaks and pits to fine-tune our ML model (Step 2)\nThis step is synonymous with data labelling required for any machine learning project where annotated data is not already available.\nThere is no perfect number of labelled examples to find per class (i.e. peak, pit, or neither). Whilst in general more exemplars (and hence more training data) is beneficial, having fewer but high quality labelled posts is far superior than more posts of poorer quality. This is extremely important due to the contrastive nature of SetFit where it’s superpower is making the most of few, extremely good, labelled data.\nBy the end of this step we need to have a list of examples posts we are confident represent what a peak or pit moment looks like for each particular product we are researching, including posts that are “neither”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we do this for each project? After so many projects now don’t we already have a good idea of what a peak and pit moment is for model training?\n\n\n\n\n\nEach peak and pit project we work on has the potential to introduce ‘domain’ specific language, which a machine learning classifier (model) may not have seen before. By manually identifying exemplar peaks and pits that are project-specific, this gives our model the best chance to identify emotional moments appropriate to the project/data at hand.\nThe obvious case for this is with gaming specific language, where terms that don’t necessarily relate to an ‘obvious’ peak or pit moment could refer to one the gaming conversation, for example the terms/phrases “GG”, “camping”, “scrub”, and “goat” all have very specific meanings in this domain that differ from their use in everyday language.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrain our model using our labelled examples (Step 3)\nThe SetFit documentation provides a really nice overview of SetFit’s foundational concepts, why this approach is suitable, and details the implementation process.\nBefore we begin training our SetFit model with our data, it’s necessary to clean and wrangle the fine-tuning datasets. Specifically, we need to mask any mentions of brands or products to prevent bias. For instance, if a certain brand frequently appears in the training data within peak contexts, the model could erroneously link peak moments to that brand rather than learning the peak-language expressed in the text.\n\nThis precaution should extend to all aspects of our training data that might introduce biases. For example, as we now have examples from various projects, an overrepresentation of data from ‘gaming projects’ in our ‘peak’ posts within our training set (as opposed to the ‘pit’ posts) could skew the model into associating gaming-related language more with peaks than pits.\n\nAt this step, we can split out our data into training, testing, and validation datasets. A good rule of thumb is to split the data 70% to training data, 15% to testing data, and 15% to validation data. By default, SetFit oversamples the minimum class within the training data, so we shouldn’t have to worry too much about imbalanced datasets- though be aware if we have extreme imbalanced we will end up sampling the same contrastive pairs (normally positive pairs) mutiple times. Indeed, our (Jamie and Aoife) experimentation has shown that class imbalance doesn’t seem to have a significant effect to the training/output of the SetFit model for peaks and pits.\nWe are now at the stage where we can actually fine-tune the model. There are many different parameters we can change when fine-tuning the model, such as the specific embedding model used, the number of epochs to train for, the number of contrastive pairs of sentences to train on etc. For more details, please refer to the Peaks and Pits Playbook\nWe can access model performance on the testing dataset by looking at accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. For peaks and pits, the most important metric is actually recall because in step 6 we reclassify posts using GPT, so we want to make sure we are able to provide as many true peak/pit moments as possible to this step, even if it means we also provide a few false positives.\n\nVisualise model separation\nA bonus that can be done to check how well our model is able to separate the different classes in embedding space, is to visualise the 2-D structure of the embeddings and see how they cluster:\n\n\n\nTrained embedding model\n\n\nFor comparison, this is what it looks like on an untrained model:\n\n\n\nUntrained embedding model\n\n\nFinally, now we are happy with our model performance based on the training and validation datasets, we can evaluate the performance of this final model using our testing data. This is data that the model has never seen, and we are hoping that the accuracy and performance is similar to that of the validation data. This is Machine Learning 101 and if a refresher is needed for this there are plenty of resources online looking at the role of training, validation, and testing data.\n\n\n\nRun inference over project data (Step 4)\nIt is finally time to infer whether the project data contain peaks or pits by using our fine-tuned SetFit model to classify the posts.\nBefore doing this again we need to make sure we do some data cleaning on the project specific data.\nBroadly, this needs to match the high-level cleaning we did during fine-tuning stage:\n\nMask brand/product mentions (using RoBERTa-based model [or similar] and Rivendell functions)\nRemove hashtags #️⃣\nRemove mentions 💬\nRemove URLs 🌐\nRemove emojis 🐙\n\n\nNote: Currently all peak and pit projects have been done on Twitter or Reddit data, but if a project includes web/forum data quirky special characters, numbered usernames, structured quotes etc should also be removed.\n\nNow we save this dataframe somewhere appropriate.\nOkay now we can finally run inference. This is extremely simple and only requires a couple of lines of code (again see the Peaks and Pits Playbook for code implementation)\nNow we have a .csv file with the probabilities each post is a peak, pit, or neither. From this we can join to our original dataframe via universal_message_id and select the classification label with the highest probability, providing us with a dataframe with all of the relevant information we need for the next steps (unviversal_message_id, message column, and peak/pit classification etc).\n\n\nThe metal detector, GPT-3.5 (Step 5)\nDuring step 4 we obtained peak and pit classification using few-shot classification with SetFit. The benefit of this approach (as outlined previously) is its speed and ability to classify with very few labelled samples due to contrastive learning.\nHowever, during our iterations of peak and pit projects, we’ve realised that this step still classifies a fair amount of non-peak and pit posts incorrectly. This can cause noise in the downstream analyses and be very time consuming for us to further trudge through verbatims.\nAs such, the aim here is to further our confidence in our final list of peaks and pits to be actually peaks and pits. Remember before we explained that for SetFit, we focussed on recall being the most important measure in our business case? This is where we assume that GPT-3.5 enables us to remove the false positives due to it’s incredibly high performance.\n\nNote: Using GPT-3.5 for inference, even over relatively few posts as in peaks and pits, is expensive both in terms of time and money. Preliminary tests have suggested it is in the order of magnitude of thousands of times slower than SetFit. It is for these reasons why we do not use GPT-x models from the get go, despite it’s obvious incredible understanding of natural language.\n\nWhilst prompt-based classification such as those with GPT-3.5 certainly has its drawbacks (dependency on prompt quality, prompt injections in posts, handling and version control of complex prompts, unexpected updates to the model weights rendering prompts ineffective), the benefits include increased flexibility in what we can ask the model to do. As such, in the absence of an accurate, cheap, and quick model to perform span detection, we have found that often posts identified as peaks/pits did indeed use peak/pit language, but the context of the moment was not related to the brand/product at the core of the research project.\nFor example, take the post that we identified in the project 706, looking for peaks and pits relating to PowerPoint:\n\nThis brings me so much happiness! Being a non-binary graduate student in STEM academia can be challenging at times. Despite using my they/them pronouns during introductions, emails, powerpoint presentations, name tags, etc. my identity is continuously mistaken. Community is key!\n\nThis is clearly a ‘peak’, however it is not accurate or valid to attribute this memorable moment to PowerPoint. Indeed, PowerPoint is merely mentioned in the post, but is not a core driver of the Peak which relates to feeling connection and being part of a community. This is as much a PowerPoint Peak as it is a Peak for the use of emails.\nTherefore, we can engineer our prompt to include a caveat to say that the specific peak or pit moment must relate directly to the brand/product usage (if relevant).\n\n\nTopic modelling to make sense of our data (Step 6)\nNow we have an extremely refined set of posts classified as either peak or pits. The next step is to identify what these moments actually relate to (i.e. identify the topics of these moments through statistical methods).\nTo do this, we employ topic modelling via BERTopic to identifying high-level topics that emerge within the peak and pit conversation. This is done separately for each product and peak/pit dataset (i.e. there will be one BERTopic model for product A peaks, another BERTopic model for product A pits, an additional BERTopic model for product B peaks etc).\nWe implement BERTopic using the R package BertopicR. As there is already good documentation on BertopicR this section will not go into any technical detail in regards to implementation.\n\n\nThe idea\nMost of our experiences are not encoded in memory, rather what we remember about experiences are changes, significant moments, and endings",

It is recommended that Google Colab is used.

It is highly recommended this ordering is kept in future projects to keep this consistent and avoid headaches in the future\nThis output dataframe can then have the relevant universal_message_id appended to it (as the row order of output_df should match sample_data, then be saved to a csv and uploaded on to the Drive to an appropriate location within the project folder\n## Append 'universal_message_id' column from sample_data to output_df\noutput_df['universal_message_id'] = sample_data['universal_message_id']\n\n# Save the modified output_df to a CSV file\noutput_df.to_csv(\"sample_predictions.csv\", index = False)\n!cp \"sample_predictions.csv\" \"appropriate/file/path/on/google/drive/in/project/directory/filename.csv\"\nA warning for this step is that SetFit does not work with empty strings in the input, so to account for this we can use the function sample_data = sample_data.fillna('') to convert empty strings to NA before converting to a list.\nNow we have a .csv file with the probabilities each post is a peak, pit, or neither. From this we can join to our original dataframe via universal_message_id and select the classification label with the highest probability (Argmax), providing us with a dataframe with all of the relevant information we need for the next steps (namely, universal_message_id, message, ‘sentiment’, and peak/pit classification).\nNote if using a model from 725 or more recent, the SetFit code has updated so we can directly obtain output classification labels rather than obtaining probabilities and needing to use R to get the labels using Argmax\npred_labels = SETFIT_model.predict(df_text)\n\nThe idea\nMost of our experiences are not encoded in memory, rather what we remember about experiences are changes, significant moments, and endings",
