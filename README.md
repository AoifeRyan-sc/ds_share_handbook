# DS at SHARE Handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to enable any new DS starter or curious analyst to be able to firstly, be able to understand what the DS team do at a high level, and secondly, be able to execute what we do.

This will be a living document, that will start of very skeletonesque and narrow, before developing into something much more fleshed out and useful.
