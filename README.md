# DS at SHARE Handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to enable any new DS starter or curious analyst to be able to firstly, be able to understand what the DS team do at a high level, and secondly, be able to execute what we do.

This will be a living document, that will start of very skeletonesque and narrow, before developing into something much more fleshed out and useful.

# Contributing to the handbook

The handbook is written with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) which makes publishing seamless, and has fast become our go-to resource for literate programming.

The first step is to clone the repo - we find this easiest in the terminal, but you could also use the GitHub Desktop application or any software you're comfortable with.

> It will usually be helpful to have a 'git_repos' folder at your home directory, which you can access in the terminal via ~/git_repos. To make this directory, open up a terminal and type `mkdir ~/git_repos`.

Provide you have a 'git_repos' folder at your home directory you can clone the repo with the following commands:
`cd ~/git_repos`
`git clone https://github.com/jamiehshare/ds_share_handbook.git` 

Now you'll want to open up your RStudio IDE, `File` -> `New Project...` -> `Existing Directory` -->  `~/git_repos/ds_share_handbook`

This will load a project at the correct location, to preview you the current state of the book open up the RStudio terminal and type `quarto preview`, this will open up a rendered version of the document in a browser. The documented will auto update as you save changes.

Now is a good idea to follow git best practices and create a fork rather than committing your changes directly to master/.

> Some projects use the master/ directory and others use main/

If I wanted to create a new branch called 'dev' I would type `git checkout -b "development"` in the RStudio terminal. My IDE would then switch to the dev branch, and I can commit my changes to dev and merge with main later.
