This section will be used to discuss best practices in data labelling, and the strategic approach used.

Jamie will start off with this, and then take bits from Jack and Aoife's write up, before getting Jack/Aoife's input on anyting Jamie missed out or misinterpreted. 

Note I've currently made a separate qmd called data_labelling_stack.qmd where I foresee the Docker, Docanno etc bits going as otherwise this page could be mega long (and also think that is best written by Jack or Aoife)
