# Glossary

**Embedding**: Numerical representations of real-world objects (in the form of a vector of real numbers)

**Embedding Model**: A model that can perform embedding by encapsulating information into dense representations in a multi-dimensional space

**F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall (enables us to integrate precision and recall into a single metric)

$$
F1 \space Score = 2 \times \dfrac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}
$$

**Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct. Precision focuses on the correctness of positive predictions

$$
Precision = \dfrac{TP}{(TP + FP) }
$$

**Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly. Recall focuses on capturing all relevant instances

$$
Recall = \dfrac{TP}{(TP + FN) }
$$
 
**Sentence Embedding**: A numerical representation of a sentence

**Word Embedding**: A numerical representation of a single word
