# AI landscape

Timbo use this qmd to write everything you need for the AI landscape.

### Background of project

Explain here why Microsoft wanted to perform the project, and the overall goal of the project. 

### Final output of project

Couple of images of the landscape perhaps- with a summary outlining what was found (don't worry about specific project details, something like "distinct topics of conversation found by human interpretation of the landscape" is better than "in 726 we found 15 new topics of which conversational AI evolved to encompass the ethics topic" which is too specific)

### How to get there

Go through a step by step approach as to how one would go about the project. For now, again don't worry about details (etc I wouldn't worry about the particular embedding model here, just say that the posts were embedded using a sentence transformer model etc).

Feel free to add screenshots of things where needed
